   <Link style={[styles.changeImageLink]}>
       <Text style={[styles.text]}><Icon type="ionicons" name='md-create'/> Change Image</Text>
   </Link>
</ImagePicker>
```

## Supported Properties

### onImageSelected

Callback to be called when image is selected. The base64 version of the image is passed as an argument to the callback.

### onPress
