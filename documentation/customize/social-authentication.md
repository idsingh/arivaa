# Social Authentication

We use expo's social authentication mechanism for using facebook and google sign in. So Please follow the instructions at the below links for configuration for both the social providers.

1. [Google](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/google.html)
2. [Facebook](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/facebook.html) 

**Important note - When you are publishing your own application, You should change the package name and bundleID in app.json for android and ios as your api configuration for google and facebook will not work if this step is not followed.**
