# Link

The purpose of this component is to provide a hyperlink kind of functionality via a component. This component is only compatible with React-Navigation, and navigates across applications just via the screen name. You can either pass children to this component or simple provide a text property which will use that text to create a link .

_Since this component uses Touchable Highlight to provide onPress behaviour, Don't use Touchable Highlight in the children._

</Link>
```
